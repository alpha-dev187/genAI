                    <h1>Screening for locations in the genome that are safe to engineer</h1>
                    <p>Synthetic biologists at the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/voigtlab/">Voigt Lab</a> need to identify any unwanted side effects they might trigger when they insert a gene into a specific location in the genome. To find suitable locations before beginning experiments, Voigt Lab researchers had been relying on qualitative prior knowledge as well as bivariate statistical analysis of relevant RNA sequencing data. This data is challenging to analyze statistically: it is high dimensional, with more than 4000 genes measured at a time, but fewer than 100 replicates. The prior knowledge is also incomplete. This workflow thus suffers from missed non-linear and multi-gene interactions, that can cause failures of synthetic biology designs.</p>

                    <p>The Bridge, in collaboration with the <a href="http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/">Probabilistic Computing Project</a> (ProbComp), applies techniques for automated data modelling to this problem which were developed by ProbComp. This technique incorporates three innovations: (i) they use models in a symbolic language that captures non-linear, heteroscedastic, multivariate interactions; (ii) Bayesian learning, to account for uncertainty given the small amount of data; and (iii) an interactive web interface that makes it easy for biologists to pose questions and examine probable answers.</p>
                    <p>This work was presented at multiple DARPA meetings for the SD2 program, and will be the basis of upcoming papers in synthetic biology and probabilistic programming.</p>
