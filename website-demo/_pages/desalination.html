                    <h1>Flow control for a low-cost solar photovoltaic-powered electrodialysis desalination</h1>
                    <p>The <a href="http://gear.mit.edu/">Global Engineering and Research Lab</a> (GEAR) has a project focused on creating a machine that can provide clean drinking water to rural India. To accomplish this, they have built the system shown below. Due to the unreliability of the electric grid, the machine uses photovoltaic cells to generate the power that will be used to desalinate the water.</p>

                    <p>The primary input to the system at a given time is flow rate, the rate at which water is pushed through the system and desalinated. Problems with the system include the increased energy required with higher flow rates, and the rate limiting step of how fast the photovoltaic cells could generate electricity.</p>
                    <p>Prior to connecting with the Quest Bridge, researchers in the group had created a high-performing controller using standard control theory methodology but it proved difficult to extend the controller to accommodate the addition of a battery (to enable the machine to run throughout intermittent weather and at night). The researchers started to implement a Reinforcement Learning-based controller but encountered some difficulties in making it work. The Quest Bridge served as consultants on the project, helping the researchers with troubleshooting and code review.</p>
