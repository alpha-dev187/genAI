                    <p>In this chapter, we'll learn about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a type of  artificial intelligence that can create all kinds of things without any help from humans.</p>
                    <h2 id="gan-is">What is a GAN?</h2>
                    <p> You know that humans can draw pictures, film videos, write stories, and compose music. You might even do some of these things yourself! But did you know that artificial intelligence programs called GANs can do these things too?</p>

                    <p>We've already read about how artificial intelligence models called neural networks can learn to classify objects. Classification is the process of figuring out what type of object something is. For example, by observing a bunch of pictures of cats and dogs, neural networks can learn how to classify pictures of cats and dogs that they've never seen before!</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>But, identifying a picture of a cat is different than creating a picture of a cat! For example, can you draw a picture of a cat from your imagination? You probably can! How do you know how to do that?</p>

                    <p>Well, you might not know, but your brain definitely does! When you want to draw a cat, your brain lights up the neurons that stores the all the information it has about what cats look like. By activating the correct neurons, your brain can generate an image of a cat in your mind.</p>

                    <p>This is how GANs work too! A GANs job is to figure out which neurons to light up in its neural network that will generate the most realistic image. Let’s look at some examples of the cool things that GANs can generate!</p>

                    <h2 id="gan-history">History of GANs</h2>
                    <p> Did you know that you're probably not that much older than most GANs> The original idea for GANs was published in 2014 by a researcher named Ian Goodfellow. They are still a pretty new technology!</p>
                    <p>You've probably gotten a lot better at drawing pictures since you were really young. Well, so have GANs! Here's a picture of how GANs have improved in the last few years.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/gans/GAN_progress.png" style="max-width: 100%;">

                    <h2 id="gan-how">How do GANs work?</h2>
                    <p>A GAN is made up of two different programs called the <b>generator</b> and the <b>discriminator</b>.</p>
                    <p> The generator and discriminator are in a constant battle - they are enemies, not friends! The generator is constantly creating new things and keeps trying to trick the discriminator into thinking the things it creates are real, while the discriminator is trying to catch any differences between what the generator is creating and things that actually exist in the real world.</p>
                    <p>Here’s how we might think of the generator and the discriminator working together: </p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/gans/counterfeit.png" style="max-width: 100%;">
                    <p>The generator is like a counterfeiter. A counterfeiter makes fake money to try to fool people into thinking it's real.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/gans/fake_money.png" style="width: 35%;">
                        <figcaption>Fake money</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The discriminator is like the police. The police can compare fake money from the counterfeiter to real money from the bank and tell the difference.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/gans/fake_money.png" style="width: 35%;">
                        <img src="../assets/images/gans/compare_arrows.png" style="width: 10%;">
                        <img src="../assets/images/gans/real_money.png" style="width: 35%;">
                        <figcaption>How does the fake money compare to the real money?</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The counterfeiter learns from its past mistakes and improves its fake money to look even more real.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/gans/improved_fake.png" style="width: 35%;">
                        <figcaption>Does this look like real money yet?</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>To make sure that the counterfeiters don't get away with making fake money, the police have to get even better at telling the difference between fake money and real money from the bank.</p>
