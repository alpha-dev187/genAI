                    <p>In this chapter, we'll learn about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a type of  artificial intelligence that can create art and music!</p>
                    <h2 id="gan-is">What is a GAN?</h2>
                    <p> You know that humans can draw pictures, film videos, write stories, and compose music. You might even do some of these things yourself! But did you know that artificial intelligence programs called GANs can do these things too?</p>

                    <p>We've already read about how artificial intelligence models called neural networks can learn to classify objects. Classification is the process of figuring out what type of object something is. For example, by observing a bunch of pictures of cats and dogs, neural networks can learn how to classify pictures of cats and dogs that they've never seen before!</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/gans/classification.png" style="max-width: 100%;">
                        <figcaption>A neural network classifying a cat</figcaption> <!-- https://becominghuman.ai/building-an-image-classifier-using-deep-learning-in-python-totally-from-a-beginners-perspective-be8dbaf22dd8 -->
                    </figure>

                    <p>But, identifying a picture of a cat is different than creating a picture of a cat! For example, can you draw a picture of a cat from your imagination? You probably can! How do you know how to do that?</p>

                    <p>Well, you might not know, but your brain definitely does! When you want to draw a cat, your brain lights up the neurons that store all the information it has about what cats look like. By activating the correct neurons, your brain can generate an image of a cat in your mind.</p>

                    <p>GANs work a little bit differently because unlike you, they don't have any information stored away in a brain. But, if you show a GAN a bunch of pictures of a cat, it will try to figure out which neurons to light up in its neural network that will generate the most realistic image of a cat. Let’s look at some examples of the cool things that GANs can generate!</p>

                    <h2 id="gan-history">History of GANs</h2>
                    <p> Did you know that you're probably not that much older than most GANs? The original idea for GANs was published in 2014 by a researcher named Ian Goodfellow. They are still a pretty new technology!</p>
                    <p>You've probably gotten a lot better at drawing pictures since you were really young. Well, so have GANs! Here's a picture of how GANs have improved in the last few years.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/gans/GAN_progress.png" style="max-width: 100%;">

                    </figure>

                    <h2 id="gan-how">How do GANs work?</h2>
                    <p>A GAN is made up of two different programs called the <b>generator</b> and the <b>discriminator</b>.</p>
                    <p> The generator and discriminator are always trying to trick each other. The generator is constantly creating new things and keeps trying to trick the discriminator into thinking the things it creates are real, while the discriminator is trying to catch any differences between what the generator is creating and things that actually exist in the real world.</p>
                    <p>Here’s how we might think of the generator and the discriminator working together: </p>
                    <p>Your art teacher would tell you that you need to create a Picasso painting. If you do it correctly, you won’t have homework for a week, but if you don’t, you get double the homework. The only problem is that you have never seen a Picasso painting before, and your teacher has seen many. So for your first try, you must come up with a random painting, and hope your teacher thinks it is a Picasso.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/gans/art_teacher.png" style="max-width: 100%;">
                        <figcaption>Trying to fool your art teacher into thinking your painting is a Picasso</figcaption> <!-- sourced from Daniella's curriculum -->
                    </figure>
                    <p>Of course, you don’t get it right the first time. Your teacher gives you feedback though, like “more color” and “more edges” and “less circles”. Each time you come back to your teacher, you feel like you are getting closer to creating a Picasso painting. Finally, your teacher believes that you've actually created a real Picasso! Her feedback has helped you become so good at imitating Picasso's style that she can't tell the difference between your painting and one that Picasso made. You are now a very good generator, and your art teacher realizes that she has to get better at telling the difference between fake and real Picassos! </p>
