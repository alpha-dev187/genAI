# GenAI

GenAI is a collaborative effort by the MIT Media Lab's Personal Robots Group and the MIT Quest for Intelligence to bring AI education to K-12 students around the world. 

## Motivation

The need for democratization of online education has become dire, especially in light of school closures and cancellations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here at the MIT Media Lab and the MIT Quest for Intelligence, we want to ensure that every student, no matter where they are, can have access to a wealth of advanced technical knowledge. To this end, we're introducing **GenAI**, an online textbook containing in-depth chapters on a variety of topics in artificial intelligence. Each chapter will be available at a beginner, intermediate, and advanced level, so learners of any age can choose the level of granularity which they are most comfortable with. 

This repo contains a prototype of what a chapter in this online textbook would look like. We chose to focus on GANs for this example chapter. In the future, we hope to grow this into a full fledged website where students of all ages can come to educate themselves on the fundamentals of AI technology.
