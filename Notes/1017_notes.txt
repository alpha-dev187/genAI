- while the color scheme and design should remain the same throughout the website,
the "feel" (font, UI) should change between content levels
- beginner: picture based, font can be child friendly
- intermediate: scratch based, font should level up to be middle/high school friendly
- advanced: ipynb based, should look like an "adult" website

todo for nisha:
- first draft of different interfaces for beginner, intermediate, advanced
- find examples of websites that do this "leveling up" well
- take a first pass at fonts
- come up with five animal characters that correspond to the five themes of AI :)
