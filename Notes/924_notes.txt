- We don't have to deal with login, we're just making a prototype to hand off to professionals
- No data collection! Too many lawyers involved
- Professional branding people will deal with color palette/logo, but we can take it and run with it as far as we want
- Start by accommodating 15-20 topics but have it be infinitely scalable
- Final prototype has to be good enough to garner funding!
