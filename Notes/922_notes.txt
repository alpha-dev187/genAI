Front page:
- Color palette: are we abiding by any branding guidelines from PRG or Quest?
- Have the topics be laid out in a "neural network", sort of like Duolingo's layout but with arrows to make it look like a neural network
- Login? No login? 
- Need to come up with logo
- Approximately how many topics are we going to have?
- Avatar system?

Choose your level page:
- This could possibly be integrated into the front page - maybe a dropdown to choose your level initially and then the roadmap that you are shown automatically redirects to the correct level curriculum?

Curriculum layout: 
- Similar to the 6.031 website
- When user reaches the bottom, maybe second chapter could automatically load up?
